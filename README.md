OpenLocationCodes
=================

Open Location Codes are short, generated codes that can be used like street addresses, for places where street addresses don't exist.

Open Location Codes were developed at Google's Zurich engineering office, and then open sourced so that they can be freely used.

This application is just a demo of my personal Java implementation of its algorithm, licensed under Apache 2.0 license.
